Public Baseline Simulation

This test simulates 75,000 transactions using Stellar's native capabilities without any enhancements from StratX.

Assumptions:
- Each transaction uses only one operation (1:1 tx:op ratio), as is typical of Stellar’s basic wallet behavior.
- No fallback route is used — each transfer is direct and static.
- No compliance checks are simulated — this represents open, default routing.
- A flat transaction latency of ~120ms and a fee of 0.00001 XLM were assumed based on standard public documentation of Stellar's performance.

What the CSV shows:
Each row is a single transaction with its ID, number of operations, assumed latency, and fee burned.  
This file represents what Stellar achieves *without* StratX — limited batching, static routing, and no automation.
