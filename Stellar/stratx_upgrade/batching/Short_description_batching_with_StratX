StratX Simulation Over Stellar

This test simulates 75,000 operations routed through a StratX layer embedded on top of Stellar.

Assumptions:
- Operations are dynamically batched into transactions with 40–49 ops each.
- Batching is optimized to minimize transaction count and reduce burn fees.
- Fallback routing alternates between XLM, USDC, and EURC.
- Compliance checks are simulated with a 'pass' flag.
- Each transaction has a latency of ~75ms and a fee proportional to batch size.

What the CSV shows:
Each row is a transaction that contains multiple operations, with metadata like route used, latency, and total cost.  
StratX uses Stellar’s batching feature to its full potential, reducing ~75,000 ledger writes to ~1,600–2,000 and lowering cost drastically.
