StratX Simulation Over Stellar

This test simulates 75,000 transactions routed through an abstracted StratX layer running on top of Stellar infrastructure.

Assumptions:
- Transactions are dynamically batched, averaging ~40–49 operations per transaction (simulated).
- Programmable fallback routing rotates across XLM → USDC → EURC paths (static simulation).
- Compliance checks are simulated with a fixed "pass" condition, not actual policy enforcement.
- A reduced transaction latency (~75ms) and lower average fee (scaled per batched op) are assumed based on optimized routing behavior.

What the CSV shows:
Each row contains a transaction ID, fallback route used, latency, fee (based on ops per tx), and compliance status.

This file represents what Stellar could achieve *with* StratX:  
Smarter routing, lower cost per operation, jurisdictional flexibility, and readiness for institutional volume.
