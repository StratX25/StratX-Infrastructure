# 🚀 Stellar Simulation Comparison: With vs Without StratX

This simulation compares 75,000 transactions processed over the Stellar network using:

1. **Stellar Native (Public Baseline):** No intelligence. No routing. No compliance.
2. **StratX Upgrade:** Dynamic fallback routing, programmable compliance (abstracted), and optimized batching.

## 📁 Folder Overview

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`public_baseline/`](./public_baseline) | Native Stellar batching simulation (1 op per tx, no logic, default latency & fees) |
| [`stratx_upgrade/`](./stratx_upgrade) | StratX-enhanced programmable simulation (fallback, batching, compliance abstracted) |

---

## 🔎 What’s Included

Each folder contains:

- `results_*.csv`: 75,000 transaction records
- `hash_report.txt`: SHA-256 hash of the CSV for proof and integrity
- `short_description.txt`:summary of the test logic (non-technical)

## 📊 Key Differences (Simulated)

| Feature | Public Baseline | StratX Simulation |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Transactions | 75,000 | 75,000 |
| Batching | ❌ 1 op per tx | ✅ 40–49 ops per tx |
| Fallback Routing | ❌ None | ✅ XLM → USDC → EURC |
| Compliance Checks | ❌ None | ✅ Simulated Pass Flag |
| Avg. Latency | ~120ms | ~75ms |
| Cost Efficiency | ❌ High Fee Burn | ✅ Optimized Fee per Op |

## 🛡️ Intellectual Property Protection

- No routing logic, filtering engine, or decision tree is present.
- No algorithms, configurations, or internal StratX code included.
- All behavior is simulated for comparative purposes only.
- Any attempt to replicate this logic for commercial use may infringe U.S. patent protections.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This simulation demonstrates what *could* be achieved using StratX as infrastructure. It does not expose, share, or embed any proprietary logic or strategic backend behavior.
