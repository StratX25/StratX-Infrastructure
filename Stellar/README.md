üöÄ StratX vs Stellar Native ‚Äì Simulation Breakdown
This simulation compares how Stellar performs under different configurations:

Public Baseline ‚Äì Real-world behavior of Stellar today
StratX Upgrade (No Batching) ‚Äì Proof that routing + compliance boost performance
StratX Upgrade (With Batching) ‚Äì Full potential unlocked using StratX‚Äôs logic


üìò 1. Public Baseline (Real-World Usage)
Although Stellar supports batching up to 100 operations per transaction, in real-world scenarios most wallets, exchanges, and custodians choose NOT to batch their transactions.

Why?

Simpler engineering (1 tx = 1 op = easier tracking)
No built-in incentives or penalties from the protocol
Lack of routing logic, fallback logic, or cost optimization
Most tooling (Horizon endpoints, SDKs) assumes 1:1 ops by default

üîç So while Stellar can batch, most of the network doesn‚Äôt.
They submit 75,000 operations as 75,000 separate transactions, each incurring full fees and latency.

That‚Äôs what‚Äôs reflected in our public_baseline/ folder.


‚öôÔ∏è 2. StratX Upgrade (No Batching)
In this simulation, we ran 75,000 transactions one by one, exactly like Stellar‚Äôs default ‚Äî but with StratX embedded.

What StratX added:

‚úÖ Fallback routing (XLM ‚Üí USDC ‚Üí EURC)
‚úÖ Compliance logic (abstracted flag)
‚úÖ Optimized routing paths
‚úÖ Reduced latency (via smart rail choice)

üìä Even with batching disabled, StratX still significantly improves performance.

This proves that routing intelligence alone can enhance Stellar‚Äôs utility for institutions, without needing protocol changes.


üîì 3. StratX Upgrade (Full Batching Enabled)
Here‚Äôs where StratX shines.

Instead of sending 75,000 operations one by one, StratX groups 40‚Äì49 ops into a single transaction ‚Äî pushing Stellar to near its full batching limit.

What this unlocks:

üîÅ Far fewer ledger writes (~1,600‚Äì2,000 tx vs 75,000 tx)
üí∏ Up to 90% savings on burn fees
‚ö° Faster throughput and finality
‚úÖ Seamless fallback routing and compliance with every batch

üìà StratX turns Stellar into the programmable batching engine it was meant to be.

This is what‚Äôs in the stratx_upgrade/ folder.

> üí° **Takeaway:** StratX doesn't just improve Stellar ‚Äî it unlocks what Stellar was built for but never delivered at scale. Full batching, compliance enforcement, fallback routing, and near-zero waste.


This simulation set was designed to prove that StratX does not replace Stellar ‚Äî it completes it.
