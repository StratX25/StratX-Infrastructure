# 💥 Stellar vs Ripple – Powered by StratX

This folder contains direct simulations comparing Ripple's XRPL system against a StratX-enhanced Stellar network.

> ⚠️ This simulation was produced in response to an external inquiry comparing Stellar's potential against XRPL under modern programmable infrastructure. The results speak for themselves.

We encourage all of those reviewing this to consider the systemic advantages enabled by StratX when layered on existing rails.

Our goal: To prove that if Stellar adopts StratX, it will surpass Ripple, and every other fintech, in every critical area — and never look back.

## 🔍 What's Inside

- `ripple_baseline/`: Ripple's current infrastructure — 75,000 txs, no batching, no compliance, static rail.
- `stellar_with_stratx/`: Same ops, batched, routed, compliant, fast — powered by StratX.
- `simulation_summary.txt`: Complete plain-English analysis of both systems.

## 🧠 Strategic Insight

Ripple currently cannot:
- Batch transactions
- Enforce compliance
- Adapt to jurisdictional control
- Route across multi-asset fallback rails

**Stellar with StratX can.**

If Stellar licenses StratX, the enitire global banking layer will shift
