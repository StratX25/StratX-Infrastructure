Ripple Baseline Simulation

This simulation processes 75,000 transactions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) using real-world assumptions:

- Each transaction is submitted individually (1 operation per transaction).
- No batching is performed; XRPL does not support native batching.
- All routing occurs on the XRP chain only (no fallback options).
- No jurisdictional compliance enforcement is simulated.
- Fees and latency are modeled on current XRPL public network benchmarks.

This reflects how XRP is used today for retail, enterprise, and liquidity applications such as RippleNet, ODL, and wallet-level transactions.
