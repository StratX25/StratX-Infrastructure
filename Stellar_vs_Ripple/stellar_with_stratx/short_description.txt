StratX Simulation on Stellar 

This simulation runs 75,000 operations on Stellar, optimized by StratX for maximum throughput, compliance, and fee efficiency.

Key features:
- Operations are dynamically batched into 40â€“49 ops per transaction.
- Multi-rail fallback routing is applied when justified: including XLM, USDC, EURC, BTC, and stablecoin intermediaries.
- StratX routes around latency, risk, or jurisdictional blocks to maintain compliance.
- Every transaction is marked with an abstracted compliance pass.
- Transaction latency and fees are reduced using optimal batch sizes and faster rails.

What the CSV shows:
Each row represents a transaction containing many ops with routing, fee, and compliance metadata.  
StratX cuts total ledger writes from 75,000 to under 2,000, drops fees to near-zero, and proves that a smart layer makes Stellar ready for global institutional infrastructure.
