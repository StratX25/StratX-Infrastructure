# StratX: Programmable Financial Infrastructure

**Invented by Abel Justin Oliveira**  
Patent Title: *Programmable Financial-Infrastructure Protocol for Sovereign Routing, Conversion, and Settlement*

---

## 🌐 What is StratX?

StratX is a protocol-level infrastructure for **real-time routing, conversion, and compliance** across fiat and blockchain-based financial systems.

It’s not a wallet. It’s not a plugin.  
It’s the **missing foundation** for global liquidity and programmable financial sovereignty.

StratX was built to serve institutions, governments, and technology providers seeking **automated, compliant, and secure financial interoperability**—starting with Ripple.

## 🔧 Why StratX?

- 🔁 **Cross-network liquidity routing** (fiat, crypto, stablecoins, CBDCs, tokenized assets)  
- 🧠 **Jurisdiction-aware enforcement** at the protocol layer (tax, audit, KYC, sanctions)  
- 🔍 **Auditability baked into infrastructure**—not added on top  
- 🪙 **Optimized for RLUSD, XRP, tokenized gold, and regulated stablecoins**  
- 🛠️ Designed for **white-label deployment** across financial institutions and sovereign systems

## 🤝 Who It’s For

StratX is designed to integrate seamlessly into both existing financial rails and emerging digital asset ecosystems. It enables programmable control at scale, across both centralized and decentralized infrastructures.

- **Ripple Labs**: Enhances ODL, bridges regulatory gaps, and routes RLUSD, XRP, and CBDCs with full compliance logic.
- **Visa & Mastercard**: Introduces programmable cross-border routing with built-in jurisdictional enforcement and audit trails.
- **Cross River Bank**: Adds programmable settlement infrastructure across fiat and tokenized rails, ideal for embedded finance.
- **Circle (USDC)** & **Tether (USDT)**: Enables institution-grade compliance, routing, and jurisdiction-aware controls across stablecoin payments.
- **Chainlink & Axelar**: StratX fills the protocol-level gap by enabling regulatory enforcement on top of cross-chain messaging.
- **Stellar Development Foundation**: StratX supercharges payment corridors with programmable conversion, routing, and sanctions enforcement.
- **IMF & Central Banks**: Deploy programmable infrastructure for sovereign-level control of compliance and liquidity without reliance on fragmented third-party apps.
