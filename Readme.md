📊 StratX Adoption Snapshot  
- 🧠 1,000+ sandbox replications  
- 🌍 Routing simulations across 3+ major blockchain rails  
- 🛡️ Compliance-first programmable infrastructure  

🛠 StratX was designed by a non-engineer to challenge engineering assumptions.

While you were optimizing for throughput, I was solving for sovereign routing control.

No background. No formal training.
Just a belief that protocol ownership is the future.

# StratX: Programmable Financial Infrastructure

**Invented by Abel Justin Oliveira**  
Patent Title: *Programmable Financial-Infrastructure Protocol for Sovereign Routing, Conversion, and Settlement*

📬 [Strategic Licensing Window Now Open](./STRATX_NOTICE.md)

## 🌐 What is StratX?

StratX is a protocol-level infrastructure for **real-time routing, conversion, and compliance** across fiat and blockchain-based financial systems.

It’s not a wallet. It’s not a plugin.  
It’s the **missing foundation** for global liquidity and programmable financial sovereignty.

StratX was built to serve institutions, governments, and technology providers seeking **automated, compliant, and secure financial interoperability**—starting with Ripple.

---

## 🔧 Why StratX?

- 🔁 **Cross-network liquidity routing** (fiat, crypto, stablecoins, CBDCs, tokenized assets)  
- 🧠 **Jurisdiction-aware enforcement** at the protocol layer (tax, audit, KYC, sanctions)  
- 🔍 **Auditability baked into infrastructure**—not added on top  
- 🪙 **Optimized for RLUSD, XRP, tokenized gold, and regulated stablecoins**  
- 🛠️ Designed for **white-label deployment** across financial institutions and sovereign systems  

---

## 🤝 Who It’s For

StratX is designed to integrate seamlessly into both existing financial rails and emerging digital asset ecosystems. It enables programmable control at scale, across both centralized and decentralized infrastructures.

- **Ripple Labs**: Enhances ODL, bridges regulatory gaps, and routes RLUSD, XRP, and CBDCs with full compliance logic.
- **Visa & Mastercard**: Introduces programmable cross-border routing with built-in jurisdictional enforcement and audit trails.
- **Cross River Bank**: Adds programmable settlement infrastructure across fiat and tokenized rails, ideal for embedded finance.
- **Circle (USDC)** & **Tether (USDT)**: Enables institution-grade compliance, routing, and jurisdiction-aware controls across stablecoin payments.
- **Chainlink & Axelar**: StratX fills the protocol-level gap by enabling regulatory enforcement on top of cross-chain messaging.
- **Stellar Development Foundation**: StratX supercharges payment corridors with programmable conversion, routing, and sanctions enforcement.
- **IMF & Central Banks**: Deploy programmable infrastructure for sovereign-level control of compliance and liquidity without reliance on fragmented third-party apps.

## 🛡️ Patent Protection

StratX is protected by a **filed U.S. non-provisional patent**.  
All implementations, sublicensing, or derivative infrastructure are subject to negotiation.

> *"StratX routes the world's money through logic, compliance, and sovereignty—not chaos."*

---

## 📈 Licensing Opportunity

StratX is available for:
- **White-label deployment** by major financial infrastructure providers  
- **Sublicensing with royalties**  
- **Exclusive jurisdictional licensing for governments or regulators**

🚨 *Limited partnerships open for early adoption. Companies may apply for strategic licensing before exclusivity windows close.*

### ✅ Simulation Integrity: Routing Flexibility — Stellar Weighted

StratX was tested with a 75,000-transaction simulation favoring Stellar using realistic fallback logic.

- 3-hop fallback architecture
- 0 false positives
- 100% success rate
- Batching: 3,000 groups of 25 transactions
- Final routing behavior:
  - Stellar: ~59%
  - XRP: ~29%
  - Ethereum: ~11%
