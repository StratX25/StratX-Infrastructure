# üîÅ Fallback Test: StratX Emergency Routing

**Objective:** Simulate infrastructure degradation to test rollback and fallback re-routing under latency, risk, and congestion conditions.

| Metric                        | Result                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Fallbacks Triggered           | 192                         |
| Avg. Cutover Time             | 430ms                       |
| Primary Failures Simulated    | Ethereum, Stellar, XRPL     |
| Rollback Success Rate         | 100%                        |
| Final Route Recovered         | FedNow (111) / FedWire (81) |

**Conclusion:** System rolled back and rerouted all failed transactions within SLA limits. Compliance snapshots preserved and signed under fallback routing hash.
