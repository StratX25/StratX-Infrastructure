## 🧠 Executive Summary

This report documents the simulated execution of StratX as a sovereign-grade programmable routing infrastructure, operating as if Ripple were functioning as the global bank and central settlement coordinator.

50,000 transactions were processed across five global regions, with real-time fallback logic, compliance scoring, and sovereign override pathways triggered in response to dynamic telemetry inputs.

The results demonstrate StratX's deterministic handling of high-volume, cross-jurisdictional asset routing — including fallback recovery, sanctions enforcement, and decentralized scoring — within policy-governed latency and integrity thresholds.

## 🧩 System Flow Overview

```
[ TX INTENT ] → [ Routing Policy Engine ] → [ Compliance Layer ] → [ Execution Layer ]
       ↓                 ↓                             ↓                     ↓
  Signature           RouteScore                KYC/Jurisdiction         XRPL / EVM / FedNow
     |                  > 0.85                       Enforcement            + Rollback Logic
  ───────→ Hashing  → Batch Grouping  → Verdict = Allow / Fallback / Block → Logging / Audit Layer
```

🛡️ All transactions logged and routed based on telemetry signals:
- Score threshold
- Compliance zone
- KYC tier
- Sanction match
- Sovereign route enforcement

## 🔐 Log Integrity Verification

**Log File:** [logs_batch_global_verified.txt](../proof/logs_batch_global_verified.txt)  
**Hash:** `dfe7910a4a4d69f8f0bc3b6971071a8b545fae67b77c21749337dc82aa9f8d26`

This SHA256 hash can be independently reproduced by hashing the exact contents of the log file using any standard utility (Linux/macOS `shasum -a 256`, Windows PowerShell `Get-FileHash`).
