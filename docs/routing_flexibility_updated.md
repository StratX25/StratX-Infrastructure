# Simulation: Strategic Routing Flexibility ‚Äî Favoring Stellar in a 75,000 TX Scenario

## Purpose

This document highlights StratX's routing programmability using a realistic fallback model. It simulates 75,000 real-world financial transactions where Stellar is preferred, but XRP and Ethereum are dynamically selected when conditions require fallback.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This simulation is not a critique of any network (including RippleNet). It‚Äôs a proof that StratX can align routing behavior with institutional, sovereign, or regulatory strategy.

---

## Realistic Hop Logic

- **1st hop success:** 84.83%
- **2nd hop fallback:** 12.23%
- **3rd hop fallback:** 2.94%
- **Zero false positives** and full success rate

---

## Final Routing Outcomes

- **Stellar:** 59.43%
- **XRP:** 29.18%
- **Ethereum:** 11.39%

> Routing weights were programmed with Stellar at 67% priority, simulating a regionally or policy-favored scenario.

---

## Why This Matters

StratX doesn‚Äôt hardcode rails. It adapts:
- To liquidity
- To jurisdictional rules
- To failover logic
- To institutional strategy

---

## Strategic Implication

Even when Stellar is favored, XRP still captured nearly 1 in 3 completions. That‚Äôs strength, not threat. But this flexibility should act as a reminder:

> Whoever controls StratX, controls the logic of money.

## Proof of Simulation

üìÅ **(./proof/logs_batch_global_stellar_weighted_summary_verified.txt)**

- 75,000 transaction log
- 3-hop fallback per TX
- Batching in groups of 25
- 100% success rate
