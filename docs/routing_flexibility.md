# Simulation: Strategic Routing Flexibility ‚Äî Favoring Stellar in a 75,000 TX Scenario

## Purpose

This document highlights StratX's routing programmability by simulating 75,000 real-world financial transactions using a preference-weighted model in favor of the Stellar network.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This simulation is not a critique of any network (including RippleNet). It‚Äôs an illustrative example of how StratX can flexibly align routing behavior with custom institutional or geopolitical preferences.

## Key Insights

- **Routing Behavior:** Stellar was assigned a slightly higher routing weight in programmable parameters to simulate a use case where liquidity sources, jurisdictional preferences, or cost models favor Stellar.
- **Fallback Logic:** XRP and Ethereum remained fallback routes in case of timeouts, compliance flags, or regional unavailability.
- **Zero False Positives:** 100% routing accuracy was maintained with programmable fallbacks, proving that reliability remains intact even under weight-biased models.

## Strategic Implication

This proves that **StratX is programmable** to align with **any sovereign or institutional preference** giving control back to the routing owner. Whether routing is directed toward Stellar, XRP, RLUSD corridors, or fiat-to-fiat channels, StratX adapts.
- StratX is **truly neutral**, allowing the owner to drive strategy.
- Institutions can onboard **without feeling boxed into one protocol**.
