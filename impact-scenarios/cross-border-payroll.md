# Scenario 03: Cross-Border Payroll for Migrant Workers

## 🌍 Problem
Millions of migrant workers send remittances home — often through expensive, slow, and unsafe channels (Western Union, informal agents, etc.). Employers also face legal risk and poor visibility when sending funds abroad.

## ✅ StratX + RouteFi Solution
- Employers onboard into RouteFi with verified payroll metadata.
- Workers receive a RouteFi-compliant wallet tagged with “Remittance-Personal.”
- StratX ensures all routes comply with both sending and receiving country laws.
- Funds are automatically routed through lowest-fee path (e.g., USDC → M-Pesa → local fiat).

## 🔁 Real-World Flow
1. A farm in California pays Mexican seasonal workers.
2. Funds route from USD → USDC → compliant corridor → Peso.
3. Worker receives funds in RouteFi wallet or local wallet linked via smart routing.
4. Entire trail is visible for audits, tax credits, and protections.

## 💡 Benefits
- No middlemen. No hidden fees.
- Workers can prove income digitally for credit or legal status.
- Governments get visibility without slowing the process.
