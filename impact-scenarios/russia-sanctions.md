Strategic Sanctions Enforcement (Russia)

## 🧨 Problem
Sanctions are notoriously porous — Russia and other state actors often route money through friendly nations or stablecoin exchanges.

## ✅ StratX + RouteFi Solution
- **RouteFi** logs each sovereign wallet with metadata: purpose, jurisdiction, and sanctions status.
- **StratX** runs every transaction through programmable compliance:
  - Is the destination wallet blacklisted?
  - Is it attempting multi-hop redirection?
  - Is it spoofing metadata?

- Blocked flows trigger alerts and optional auto-reporting to OFAC/EU regulators.

## 🔁 Real-World Simulation
1. Russia attempts to receive oil payments through a friendly third country.
2. StratX identifies sanction-evading routing logic and auto-blocks.
3. Transaction is flagged in RouteFi’s compliance module.

## 🛡️ Benefits
- Real-time programmable sanctions enforcement.
- Makes global evasion far more difficult.
- Sets the stage for international agreement on enforcement infrastructure.
