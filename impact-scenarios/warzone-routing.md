# Scenario 05: Precision Routing in Active Warzones

## ⚔️ Problem
Warzones create financial chaos. Civilians can't access aid. Banks collapse. Rogue actors reroute or steal funds meant for evacuation or relief. Most financial rails fail under real-time kinetic pressure.

## ✅ StratX + RouteFi Solution
- **Pre-designated 'warzone wallets'** activated by sovereign, UN, or NGO partners.
- StratX dynamically reroutes around disabled rails, using fallback logic (e.g., crypto → satellite mesh → local stablecoin). 
- RouteFi ensures only verified operators (e.g., Red Cross, medics, civil shelters) can access wallets.
- Multi-layer ID + location tagging prevents spoofing or interception.

## 🔁 Real-World Flow
1. Refugees in Ukraine need emergency funds.
2. StratX detects regional rail failure and routes through alternate corridor (e.g., XLM → USDT → local partner).
3. RouteFi wallet can only spend funds at geo-approved shelters or vendors.
4. All data logged for Geneva-compliant oversight.

## 🔐 Benefits
- Funds reach civilians, not militants.
- Works during internet outages or infrastructure collapse.
- Promotes trust in wartime relief funding.
