# Scenario 01: Humanitarian Aid in Sanctioned Zones

## 🌍 Problem
Nations under sanctions struggle to receive critical aid — especially medical supplies — without risk of funds being stolen, misused, or rerouted through black markets.

**Example**: A sanctioned country suffers a disease outbreak. Donors hesitate to send funds because they could be misused by the regime.

## ✅ StratX + RouteFi Solution

- **StratX** routes funds *only* to wallets tagged as humanitarian, enforcing use-specific compliance.
- **RouteFi** issues a soulbound NFT to each government-authorized wallet, verifying identity, purpose, and jurisdiction.
- Smart contracts block funds from leaving aid wallets to non-whitelisted suppliers.

## 🔁 Real-World Flow
1. UN logs approved vendors (medical suppliers) into RouteFi.
2. StratX routes donor funds via optimal rail (e.g., RLUSD, EURC, etc.) to the verified aid wallet.
3. Wallet can *only* purchase from pre-approved lists.
4. All funds are monitored on-chain with full auditability.

## 🔒 Benefits
- Prevents misuse or laundering of aid.
- Ensures delivery of medicine, food, and essentials.
- Builds trust in aid delivery mechanisms.
