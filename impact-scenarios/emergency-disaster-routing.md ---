# Scenario 04: Emergency Routing During Natural Disasters

## 🌪️ Problem
When disaster strikes, funding gets stuck — routing delays, manual approvals, jurisdictional issues, or lack of verified recipients kill response time.

## ✅ StratX + RouteFi Solution
- Emergency wallets pre-registered in RouteFi, tied to national disaster response agencies, NGOs, and municipal responders.
- StratX prioritizes and fast-tracks routing to these addresses during certified events.
- Funds auto-unlock based on GPS metadata, vendor match, and protocol logic (e.g., shelter, fuel, food).

## 🔁 Real-World Flow
1. Earthquake hits Haiti. U.S. and UN release funding.
2. StratX routes through optimal corridor (e.g., RLUSD → USDC → Local aid wallet).
3. RouteFi validates usage: if recipient isn't certified, funds freeze.
4. Recovery is logged, funds auditable in real-time.

## 🔥 Bonus
- Includes optional smart “trigger” that unlocks funds based on early warning systems or NGO verification.
