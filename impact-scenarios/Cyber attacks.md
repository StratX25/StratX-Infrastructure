# 📡 Why StratX Matters in a Fragile Internet Era

Recent events, like the AWS internet shutdown on October 20, 2025, have highlighted just how fragile our digital infrastructure can be. During that outage, several major banks experienced service interruptions for hours, resulting in significant financial losses. While exact figures are still being tallied, outages like this can easily translate into tens of millions of dollars in lost transactions and fees, not to mention the broader ripple effects on customers and markets.

## 🛡️ How StratX Provides a Safety Net

StratX is built with multiple fallback rails and routing layers. That means even if one major cloud provider goes down, the system can seamlessly reroute through other infrastructure. As a result, banks remain operational, financial services stay stable, and customers avoid unnecessary chaos. Without StratX, these kinds of outages could put banks and their customers in a far more vulnerable position.
