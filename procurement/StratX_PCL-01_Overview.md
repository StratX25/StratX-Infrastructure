# StratX™ Procurement Capability & Licensing Overview (PCL-01)
### *For Federal Contracting and SDVOSB Partnership Alignment*

---

## **1. Executive Summary**
**StratX™** is a *Programmable Financial-Infrastructure Protocol* designed for real-time routing, conversion, and settlement of digital and fiat assets across multiple rails—blockchain, banking, and institutional networks.  
Developed by **Abel Justin Oliveira**, StratX unifies compliance, liquidity optimization, and jurisdictional control into a single programmable layer, enabling the U.S. government and defense contractors to modernize legacy financial systems in alignment with Section 889, DFARS 252.204-7012, and NIST 800-171 standards.

| **Cross-Rail Routing Engine** | Programmed real-time routing of value between CBDCs, stablecoins, and fiat networks (FedNow, FedWire, SWIFT, XRPL, Stellar, Ethereum). |
| **Compliance-Aware Architecture** | Built-in policy enforcement, OFAC screening, sanctions detection, and jurisdictional logic. |
| **Adaptive Settlement Layer** | Provides deterministic settlement sequencing, fallback routing, and multi-signature validation. |
| **Telemetry & Audit Layer** | Enables supervisory read/write endpoints for real-time auditing, telemetry, and performance validation. |
| **Programmable Policy Oracles** | Integrates with Treasury or DoD compliance feeds to enforce rule changes dynamically. |
