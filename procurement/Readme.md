## **Overview**
The **StratX™ Procurement Repository** provides government agencies, SDVOSBs, and institutional partners with public-facing summaries of StratX capabilities, contracting pathways, and licensing readiness.  
This folder is designed to support federal procurement review while maintaining full intellectual-property protection.

All technical logic, pricing, and proprietary materials are secured under NDA in a separate private repository.

## **Mission**
StratX™ is a **Programmable Financial-Infrastructure Protocol** that unifies cross-rail routing, conversion, and settlement across blockchain and traditional payment systems.  
It enables compliance-aware interoperability between CBDCs, stablecoins, and fiat networks — aligning with **Section 889**, **DFARS 252.204-7012**, and **NIST 800-171** requirements.

The system provides the foundational infrastructure for real-time, policy-aware liquidity orchestration across global and domestic financial networks.
